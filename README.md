# What is touch?
The touch is a standard command used in the UNIX/Linux operating system to create files for windows.

# Why?
I decided to make this software because there is no touch command in Windows operating systems.

# How to Use?
First, you need to add **touch** to system path.

One file creating
```
touch <filename>
```

Multiple file creating
```
touch <firstfilename> <secondfilename> <thirdfilename>
```
